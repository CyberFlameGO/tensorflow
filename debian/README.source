README.Debian
=============

Principles specific to this source package
------------------------------------------

1. Don't use code from tensorflow/contrib as long as possible.

   They are not officially supported by upstream.

2. This source packages provides CPU-only verison of TF instead
   of CUDA version. Necessity of CPU-only Version:
  
   (1) Compilable on all architectures. CUDA is specific to amd64
       and ppc64el, and aarch64. What's even worse, we don't have
       available CUDA compiler for aarch64.

   (2) CPU-only Version can stay in the main section. Once compiled
       with CUDA, the source must enter contrib section.

   That being said, please don't remove CUDA related build from the
   build system because that would be easier for maintainer to
   synchronize the CUDA version and CPU version.

   src:caffe and src:caffe-contrib is an example for illustration.

3. Build nothing from contrib as long as possible. Code in contrib
   is not officially supported.


Debian's own cmake/make build
-----------------------------

 Google is going to drop cmake build. This packaging project forked
 the CMake build system from TensorFlow v1.10.0 and modified it.
 See debian/cmake/README.md for detail.

 Building TF consumes much memory. A rough observation is that you
 need more than 32GB of memory for debuild -J8 (ppc64el), especially
 when linking multiple ELF biaries in parallel. Maybe this situation
 can be improved by tweaking the cmake build.

 Tensorflow's makefile build is also forked to debian/make. Different
 from CMake, this set of makefile only compiles the core library
 with the minimal functionality set as possible.

 CMake build is used for AMD64 and PPC64EL, which are able to train
 neural networks. Other architectures use Makefile to compile
 a tensorflow library with core functionality set, with which
 at least they can conduct the forward pass with pretrained neural
 networks. AArch64 uses Makefile because I don't have energy
 to care about Tegra or CUDA-AArch64.

Debian's Native Makefile
------------------------

  1. bash debian/bazelQuery.sh
  2. cat debian/flags.mk
  3. make -f debian/proto_text.mk
  4. make -f debian/tf_proto_text.mk
  5. make -f debian/tf_proto.mk
  6. make -f debian/tf_knl_ops.mk
  ...


Ambiguous FFT2D license
-----------------------

 https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2018/08/msg00005.html
 https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/21724
 Well, let's assume it's a free license.


Things remain to be done
========================

Exp-Stage A
-----------

Only C and C++ interface is provided.

- [x] prevent the build system from downloading anything.
- [x] deal with all the C/C++ lib dependencies.
- [x] produce libtensorflow.so.1.10 and install it into .deb package.
- [x] ambiguous FFT2D license.
- [x] architectures that doesn't make cmake.
- [x] sort out this confusing lintian E
      source-is-missing tensorflow/compiler/aot/codegen_test_o.golden
      Done: https://salsa.debian.org/lintian/lintian/commit/75a5b2d4ef35346200588ceaa8a4d26143f42195
- [x] parallel ld triggers OOM killer. CXXFLAGS += -gsplit-dwarf

- [ ] build tests files (googletest) and run the tests.
- [ ] is the resulting libtensorflow.so.1.10 correct and working?
  - [ ] write autopkgtest with some mini C/C++ programs.
  - [ ] working on amd64?
  - [ ] working on ppc64el?
- [ ] make sure libtensorflow/amd64 is linked against libmkldnn
- [ ] remaining lintian warnings and errors.
- [ ] traverse the 16000+ files in the source tree and complete d/copyright.  ummmmmmmmmm.............
- [ ] get rid of this error
      /usr/bin/ld: error: benchmark_model(.debug_info) is too large (0x35a9f359 bytes)
      /usr/bin/ld: error: benchmark_model(.debug_str) is too large (0x6a545d15 bytes)
      /usr/bin/ld: error: benchmark_model(.debug_loc) is too large (0x1f5b1950 bytes)
      make[3]: Leaving directory '/<<BUILDDIR>>/tensorflow-1.10.0+dfsg/obj-x86_64-linux-gnu'
      [ 98%] Built target benchmark_model
      /usr/bin/ld: error: compare_graphs(.debug_info) is too large (0x366f36be bytes)
      /usr/bin/ld: error: compare_graphs(.debug_str) is too large (0x6a64010e bytes)
      /usr/bin/ld: error: compare_graphs(.debug_loc) is too large (0x1fd19fe0 bytes)
- [ ] (cmake) prevent "make install" from building everything again?
- [ ] check the difference between makefile and cmake.
  - [ ] We really need the CMake build?
- [ ] cleanup the mess in cmake/makefile, removing useless stuff. make them easier to read.
- [ ] we have three build systems now ... we must remove two.

- [ ] upload to experimental.

Exp-Stage B
-----------

Provide the Python interface.

- [ ] do we have all the required python dependencies?
- [ ] build pywrap_tensorflow_internal.so
- [ ] figure out how to generate python API
- [ ] install python files
- [ ] is the resulting python package correct and working?
- [ ] write autopkgtest with some mini python programs.
- [ ] make sure nothing from contrib is built.
- [ ] maintain cmake build.

- [ ] bump debian revision to -B* and upload to experimental.

Not Decided Yet
---------------

- [ ] re-enable GRPC support. (FTBFS since 1.13 -> 1.14 in experimental)
      As long as TF doesn't FTBFS with it.
- [ ] upload to unstable.
      Wait for protobuf, mkl-dnn, (and possibly grpc) to enter unstable.
- [ ] Compile both AVX+ version and Generic version. Automatically
      choose the working one during postinst according to the machine's
      cpu capability.
- [ ] core/debug
- [ ] core/distributed_runtime

Will Never Get Fixed
--------------------

- [ ] 32-bit architecture support, if it FTBFS.
- [ ] weak architecture support (incl. mips*, arm*, etc), if it FTBFS.
- [ ] symbols control file. C++ symbols is a nightmare.
- [ ] Javascript binding tensorflow.js if no one works on it.
- [ ] Go binding if no one works on it.
- [ ] Java binding if no one works on it.
- [ ] compile and provide documentation if no one works on it.
- [ ] GPU (CUDA) support if no one works on it.
      .
      If you want the CUDA version, why not use TensorFlow official binaries?
      .
      This requires us to prepare another copy of source code and
      rename it to tensorflow-cuda. (just like what I've done for
      src:caffe and src:caffe-contrib). Apart from that, without
      cuDNN, the GPU version will be pointless and useless.
      CUDA version of tensorflow is not planned yet. At the same
      time the CUDA version could also be linked against MKL.
