tensorflow (1.10.1+dfsg-A1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Initial release [1.10.1+dfsg]. (Closes: #804612)
  * Stage A (with Debian revision "A*") indicates that the source
    package only produces C and C++ library and development files.
  * Many thanks to Aron Xu <aron@debian.org> for his sponsorship
    of the access to his build machine which helped a lot when
    creating this package.
