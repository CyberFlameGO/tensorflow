tensorflow (2.0.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 2.0.0 (Re-introduced after ROM).
  * Rewrite the buildsystem, which rebuilds the dependency graph from
    Bazel buildlog, and generates a usable Ninja bulid to approximate
    the original results. The reverse-engineering-styled build could
    produce better results compared to the previous build systems.
